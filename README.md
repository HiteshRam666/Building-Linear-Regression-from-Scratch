# Building-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch

Linear Regression:
Y = wX + b

Y --> Dependent Variable

X --> Independent Variable

w --> weight

b --> bias

Gradient Descent:
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used for minimizing the loss function in various machine learning algorithms. It is used for updating the parameters of the learning model.

w = w - α*dw

b = b - α*db

Learning Rate:
Learning rate is a tuning parameter in an optimization algorithm that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
